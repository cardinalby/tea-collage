Very often they are wrapped in a paper wrapper with a beautiful art made for particular tea by order of a store or supplier. I always felt sorry to throw out these wrappers, so I came up with the idea to cut fragments out of them and present the fragments in the form of a collage.",
      "Now this collage hangs in a frame under the glass, and there is a QR code in its center that leads to this site, where you can see what the whole wrappers looked like, fragments of which are shown on the collage and read more about each tea.",
